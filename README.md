# Sentiment_Analysis

### 1. Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can predict the rating of a product or service based on the reviews provided by customers

### 2. Data Collection and Preparation:
The dataset for this project will be collected from popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon  where users rate products or services and provide written reviews. The dataset will consist of reviews along with their corresponding ratings (usually on a scale of 1 to 5). The dataset will be preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuations, and converting all text to lowercase and all reviews are converted into english language.

### 3. Model Building:
The deep learning model will be built using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model will be trained on the preprocessed dataset, and the output will be a predicted rating for each review. The model will be optimized using a suitable loss function and trained using backpropagation.

### 4. Model Evaluation:
To evaluate the performance of the model,We check the accuracy of model

### 5. Conclusion:
The final outcome of this project will be a deep learning model that can predict ratings from reviews with high accuracy. This model can be used by businesses to analyze customer feedback and improve their products or services accordingly. It can also be used by consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing products or services online.
